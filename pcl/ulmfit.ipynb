more fair .',\n"," 'He did not loosen his links with the athletes when projected upwards into the Presidency .',\n"," 'Provided their behaviour was sportsmanlike and safe , oarsmen found only encouragement and humour from a President who was always among them .',\n"," \"Keller 's Zurich upbringing made him into a skiier and sculler , and he raced for the Grasshopper club .\",\n"," 'FISA was then a relatively unimportant body which organised European and other championships and participated in the running of Olympic regattas .',\n"," 'As a rich , forceful young man , Keller had been earmarked as a likely future president , even before Mullegg was killed in an aircrash in 1958 .',\n"," 'He sat on the appropriate boards of the International Olympic Committee and was President of the General Assembly of International Sports Federations for 17 years .',\n"," 'These positions were not held for his own status but to promote the cause of rowing where it needed clout .',\n"," \"He successfully defended rowing as an Olympic sport and in 1976 introduced women 's events , which have now expanded to six classes .\",\n"," 'His personal preference for sculling over rowing assisted the introduction of quadruple sculls to world championship and Olympic competition .',\n"," 'Keller was made a Steward of Henley Royal Regatta in 1976 , a time when the proliferation of new six-lane , still-water courses around the world , which had emerged under his guidance , seemed a threat to the regatta founded in 1829 .',\n"," 'But it was the spirit of Henley , with huge crowds enjoying amateur sport , presented with administrative finesse , which Keller took as the yardstick for the international circuit .',\n"," 'He loved the place and he returned every year to play an often small part as umpire of races between undistinguished clubs far below the Olympic standard he was obliged to administer .',\n"," 'During his term as President of FISA he gradually reduced his role in Eduard Keller Ltd and used the company offices to provide a world headquarters for rowing .',\n"," 'The sport is now obliged to find income from the more normal sources of television and sponsorship , to replace his largely unacknowledged private patronage .',\n"," 'In spite of his gift to the sport , Keller was anxious not to abuse his status as President and never went to a rowing event unless invited .',\n"," \"He was enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the English could make a contest between two crews which would not rank in the World 's top 10 into a bigger spectacle than the Olympic final .\",\n"," 'The final task he set himself for his Presidency , which was due to end next year , was to weed out of the Regatta calendar all the rowing courses which could be made unfair by the wind .',\n"," 'Drink : Desire in search of a name : Do the French have the mot juste to describe the desire for a reviving drink ?',\n"," 'In the first of a monthly series

both drinks ( as Queen Victoria reputedly did with claret and malt whisky ) , but still the result is not especially quenching .',\n"," 'New Orleans favours a mid-morning milk punch , or its own variation on the gin fizz .',\n"," 'None of these requires anything even approaching a thirst .',\n"," 'Do we really wash down a good meal with claret ?',\n"," 'Port is immediately suggested by Stilton ; cognac by coffee .',\n"," 'These are not moments of thirst but nor are they causes of drunkenness ( unless one tries to pack all such experiences into one day ) .',\n"," 'A friend of mine

to fight for our freedom .\",\n"," \"Hill expresses the way time has cheated them : his daughter was born while he was remanded in custody , and is now 14 : She would change dramatically and I did n't feel a change in myself mentally .\",\n"," 'But again it was Conlon , the slightly wild-eyed Irish poet of the quartet , articulate , flamboyant remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the Old Bailey who cut deep into the collective conscience .',\n"," \"And at the end , Conlon drew the one hopeful conclusion : If this stops capital punishment ever coming back , the time I 've spent in prison will be well worth it .\",\n"," \"We get a custody order , and that 's it .\",\n"," \"IT was n't the only programme last night to shine light into dirty corners .\",\n"," 'Inside The

internationals , yet they recently lost to both Munster and Ulster in the Inter-Provincial Championship .',\n"," 'Such is the mood of pessimism here it is hard to find anyone who believes the All

undermined by their failure to secure prestige fixtures since the mid-Seventies .',\n"," 'When New Zealand last toured Ireland in 1978 Leinster were ignored .',\n"," 'The same thing happened in 1984 when the province was denied a fixture against the Wallabies .',\n"," \"Even so , the All Blacks , who include seven capped players , will give today 's opponents due respect .\",\n"," 'As their coach , Alex Wyllie , remarked : When we arrived in Wales we were told Cardiff were no damned good and look how well they played against us .',\n"," 'The Test flanker Alan Whetton , whose hamstring injury

closely .',\n"," \"The members , many of whom are unable to fulfil the latest Ì´å£101m cash call due on March 2 to cover 1989åäÌÝÌÕ90 losses on syndicates were seeking an interim injunction to stop

its first duty to policyholders with valid claims which must be met , he said .\",\n"," 'Mr Freeman said an appeal was most unlikely , because we are not going to get any more evidence .',\n"," \"Earlier this month , preliminary findings from an investigation by Kenneth Randall found that the Gooda Walker agency may have overstated its syndicates ' profits between 1981 and 1988 through the use of time and distance policies , about which it had failed to inform its auditors in at least one syndicate .\",\n"," 'Peter Nutting , who led the association of Outhwaite members to a succesful

currency through the stage works of Philip Glass .',\n"," \"In Four Saints Thomson 's informality was given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then , when it stuck , wrote it down to a figured bass .\",\n"," 'He said : I had wondered whether a piece so drenched in Anglican chant ( running from Gilbert and Sullivan to Morning Prayer and back ) could rise and sail .',\n"," \"The opera , like Gershwin 's Porgy and Bess the following year , used an all-Black cast and the staging and choreography gave it a British connection since it was by Frederick Ashton .\",\n"," 'The Mother of Us All shows more continuity , but again much depends upon production in what is still a largely non-narrative opera .',\n"," \"In 1936 , three years before Aaron Copland , Thomson started writing film scores which were a model of unobtrusive clarity and pertinence , combining American materials to suit documentaries such as The Plow that Broke the Plains and The River with the musique d'ameublement approach of Satie .\",\n"," 'His score for the film Louisiana Story was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 .',\n"," \"Just as Thomson transferred Stein 's literary abstraction to music , so these portraits unusually employ the painter 's technique of drawing the sitter from life : an ideal combination of Thomson 's habit of immediate response with an actual subject .\",\n"," 'The results are terse and sharply etched , like the best line drawings .',\n"," 'Thomson could control words with the same fastidiousness as notes .',\n"," 'He always felt that effective musical criticism began by being well written , and he never lost his liveliness .',\n"," 'From 1940 to 1954 he wrote regularly for the New York Herald Tribune and four volumes of his notices have appeared in book form .',\n"," 'He wrote a fulsome 400-page autobiography , characteristically entitled Virgil Thomson on Virgil Thomson , and a personal survey , American Music since 1910 , appeared in 1972 , followed recently by a selected edition of his letters .',\n"," 'As both composer and critic he touched both sides of the coin : A climate of receptivity is what the artist most desires .',\n"," \"Thomson 's judgements about music were not always as accurate as his confident expression implied : he invited discussion .\",\n"," 'Above all he restored the focus of music criticism onto the music itself .',\n"," 'He made no secret of his Francophile enthusiasms , in reaction to the earlier domination of American music by Germans , and he was one of the first writers to register the importance of jazz .',\n"," 'He fearlessly attacked convention , which caused problems when he pitched into established reputations .',\n"," 'It has become increasingly apparent that Thomson belonged to the American experimental tradition .',\n"," 'A few years later Thomson recognised Cage as the most original composer in America , if not the world and Cage repaid the compliment by writing the works section of a monograph on Thomson .',\n"," \"But finally , in spite of their common roots in Satie and Stein , Thomson felt that Cage 's aesthetic was destructive .\",\n"," \"Thomson 's songs contain some of his finest work .\",\n"," 'There are Stein settings , such as Portrait of FB , but also cycles such as Five Songs from William Blake , Prayers and Praises and a cantata based on poems by Edward Lear .',\n"," 'From there , like a buzzard in its eyrie , he would make forays round the US and abroad in spite of his advanced age .',\n"," 'He seemed a genial and indestructible landmark in the history of American music , in spite of defective hearing which had bothered him since the late Seventies .',\n"," 'He had a photograph of himself on his postcards and he signed his letters following the original tailpiece everbest .',\n"," 'Thomson came from a generation of American composers which had to find its own way without benefit of university patronage .',\n"," 'OLDHAM Athletic , who had never beaten a First Division side since they dropped into the Second Division in 1923 , made up for 66 years of not altogether patient waiting with a pulsating victory over the League champions Arsenal at Boundary Park last night .',\n"," 'The Pennines fairly shook .',\n"," 'Two goals from the irrepressible Andy Ritchie , his 13th and 14th this season , and a third by the 20-year-old midfield player Nick Henry , and Arsenal were sunk with only the trace of a last-minute goal by Quinn .',\n"," \"They held their line and competed hard in midfield , damping down Oldham 's initial verve and preparing themselves for more of the same in the second half .\",\n"," 'Then Oldham struck .',\n"," \"Winterburn almost put the ball into his own net from Milligan 's cross , O'Leary recovering an awkward situation .\",\n"," 'Oldham took up the attack again and Barlow , who had a fine match at left-back , totally containing Rocastle , floated in a deep cross beyond Winterburn .',\n"," 'The predatory Ritchie chested the ball down and hammered a volley past Lukic .',\n"," 'Arsenal had no choice but to attack as soon as the second half began .',\n"," 'A neat step-over by Rocastle sent Thomas hurtling in on goal but Rhodes moved sharply off his line to smother the shot .',\n"," \"From the resulting corner Rhodes made another fine save , hurtling to his right to deflect away Dixon 's rising shot .\",\n"," \"Finally , with Arsenal pressing hard , he clawed away Quinn 's careful header from Thomas 's drag-back .\",\n"," 'Worse , far worse was to follow .',\n"," 'Bunn , who scored six goals in the previous round against Scarborough , this time turned into the provider , putting Milligan clear and free .',\n"," \"Holden 's 64th-minute free-kick clattered the wall and the ball fell to Henry , who drilled a low shot from more than 30 yards inside Lukic 's right-hand post .\",\n"," 'Arsenal were stitched and stuffed , with no question of a fluke .',\n"," 'Not for the first time this season their defence had been found wanting and Oldham exploited the weaknesses to the full , owing a special debt to the inspiration and tireless running of Henry and Milligan .',\n"," \"The manager 's attitude shows why they are champions .\",\n"," 'He took it on the chin .',\n"," \"We rattled them from the first minute and did n't give them any breathing space .\",\n"," 'We were helter-skelter for 90 minutes and we scored three great goals .',\n"," 'In the past we have had cup walks , not runs .',\n"," 'Berg was also an agent of the Office of Strategic Services , which was later to give birth to the CIA .',\n"," 'His job was to convince Amaldi to pack his bags because there was a ship waiting at Naples to take him to the United States .',\n"," \"Amaldi dodged the American invitation , perhaps because ( with Rome liberated ) Fermi 's mantle in physics had fallen on his young shoulders and there were younger minds to teach .\",\n"," 'He wore that mantle well at Rome University until his retirement in 1978 .',\n"," 'But Amaldi never really retired nor grew old .',\n"," \"He kept regular hours in the university 's physics building , spoke at scientific meetings this year in Moscow and Washington .\",\n"," 'As President of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei he had delivered the welcoming address on Tuesday to a symposium of scientists .',\n"," 'He then ordered a car to call for him the next morning for a similar occasion and was felled by a stroke while waiting for the lift .',\n"," 'Amaldi grew up in a small town in Lombardy , and took his doctorate in physics from Rome at the remarkably early age of 21 .',\n"," \"It is interesting to note that the pope as the kids called Fermi because he 's always right , was only seven years older than Amaldi .\",\n"," 'Amaldi astounded his group in October 1934 with his discovery that by slowing down , rather than accelerating , neutrons , he could provoke intense nuclear reactions .',\n"," 'He held a chair in physics from 1937 until his retirement publishing more than 150 papers on atomic and nuclear physics .',\n"," 'He was awarded honorary degrees by Algiers , Glasgow and Oxford .',\n"," 'I knew almost nothing about physics but we shared some jokes about the Rome telephone system .',\n"," 'In 1949 , Amaldi wrote to the Italian prime minister asking for permission to produce and sell sealing wax for letters , so that we may raise needed funds for our physics lab .',\n"," 'The reply came from an under-secretary who said that the present funding was considered adequate and the commercial undertaking would be ill-advised .',\n"," 'Sir : If Labour is to suggest the setting up of a specialist labour court ( 30 September ) , then such a momentous change in the industrial relations system deserves more discussion , and needs to be taken out of the hot-house of Labour Party conference politics .',\n"," 'For three reasons such a move should be welcomed .',\n"," 'First , it would bring Britain into line with the best European practice , notably in Germany where local , regional and federal labour courts handle problems in a fair , dispassionate way based on law , precedent and judicial expertise in the labour field .',\n"," 'Second , it would ensure that workers enjoyed positive rights under law and reduce the emphasis of union immunities .',\n"," 'Labour law will always reflect the balance of power in society , and a fully fledged labour court system will not remove class and fundamental employer-employee differences .',\n"," 'But it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd see-sawing of industrial relations legislation we have seen since 1969 .',\n"," 'The trade union question would cease to haunt the Labour Party and while that might upset some Conservatives it would be good for the country .',\n"," 'Scientists click over a way to save dolphins',\n"," 'They

numbers of dolphins off Cornwall this year .',\n"," 'But their work is hampered by lack of money .',\n"," 'So far they have received nothing from the Government , little EC assistance and are running out of funds donated by individuals and industry .',\n"," 'The researchers , headed by Dr Margaret Klinowska , a Cambridge biologist , and David Goodson , an expert on acoustic engineering at Loughborough University , say new data shows that plastic sound reflectors to fishing nets can warn dolphins of hazards .',\n"," 'Using equipment donated by Racal , the scientists have analysed recordings of the clicking dolphins make while hunting .',\n"," 'Observations of Freddy led them to conclude that dolphins use sonar while hunting .',\n"," 'Mr Goodson , who became interested in the sonar capacity of dolphins after hearing one while swimming off the Welsh coast , has experimented with various shapes of sound reflectors .',\n"," \"The theory is that its internal air pocket will bounce back the dolphin 's sonar signal , regardless of the direction of approach .\",\n"," 'Last autumn , Dr Klinowska , Mr Goodson and their team put the theories into practice .',\n"," 'Dolphins swimming near the barrier altered their behaviour to avoid it , the result , the scientists believe , of them detecting sonar echoes from the reflectors .',\n"," 'Dr Klinowska said that , although it was necessary to be cautious about the findings , a combination of reflector devices and some modification of fishing gear might reduce deaths .',\n"," 'But the Moray Firth experiments were only
